# Why we invested in Mintbase

Not financial advice.

## Introduction

A central tenet of Sino Global Capital’s thesis is investing in the building blocks of the digital economy. We strive to keep informed of the latest developments in Blockchain and Web 3.0 so we can support, build and shape the future of the industry. When NFTs came on the scene we were very intrigued and saw a lot of potential for the technology in the future. They are an exciting, fast-growing, and fundamental building block with numerous unlocked use cases. What we did not see, however, were many attractive entry points.

## NFTs

What makes NFTs powerful are their potential to tokenize a physical asset and create a digital representation of the underlying asset. This is especially useful for illiquid assets or assets that do not represent value outside their “environment”. A clear example of illiquid assets is real estate. With the emergence of NFTs, those illiquid assets can easily be digitalized and moved around, which leads to innovative opportunities. Given that NFTs are assets, these can be borrowed or lent out as collateral, generating more cash flow. Games are another relevant example of why NFTs are powerful. Skins in Fortnite or League of Legends cannot be traded or exchanged outside the game. However, with NFTs and marketplaces, those “assets” can be exchanged for value outside their original game. With NFTs, standardization will become more obvious as it enables digital assets to move freely across various platforms, realizing interoperability and connectivity while giving ownership pack to the user.

The recent focus on NFTs has been on tokenizing collectibles like music and art, but there’s a huge opportunity in physical items that are pegged to NFTs (event tickets, for example). Furthermore, NFTs are a natural complement to DeFi.



## Evolving use cases

The use cases for NFTs do not stop there. NFTs will allow more imaginative and creative applications. As NFTs evolve over time, they can be designed to provide the end-user with a more customized experience or perhaps certain privileges. For instance, with exclusive, rare NFTs that represent limited tickets can give holders limited access to a private group or community in which they can interact with the creator. NFTs can also allow individuals to establish certain identities, which can be leveraged to create social networks or communities. In essence, NFTs as an experience will allow construction of new digital identities and reputations. They can enable new perspectives about a user or community, all with their hobbies, preferences and/or goals incorporated. Currently this information is in hands of BigTech, e.g. Amazon, Google and Facebook.


To focus on the building blocks of the digital economy, we had no interest in investing in a single plot of digital real estate or in- game collectable. Ideally, we wanted to find a team building the space itself rather than building within it. We weren’t interested in just acquiring a few NFTs for a trade but wanted to support the technology and ecosystem at its core.



## Mintbase

We looked for a best-in-class team in the NFT ecosystem that had a long-term vision compatible with our long-term investment horizon. Then we found Mintbase (<a href='https://mintbase.io/' target='_blank'>https://mintbase.io/</a>). A marketplace that gives users the tools to exchange NFTs. What distinguishes Mintbase from other competitors is that users and participants can also mint NFTs and offers NFTs which are not frequently available on other platforms. Users can also create their own store.

Furthermore, Mintbase strives to bridge content creators, artists and others with those that appreciate and value their work. Mintbase currently covers NFT segments such as music, art, services, tickets, photography and more.

However, we have only just begun to envision the applications of NFTs. A new trend is the financialization of NFTs, whereby the tokens have even been used to represent insurance policies. Whatever is next for NFTs, we are confident that Mintbase will be at the forefront of innovation. The founders, <a href='https://twitter.com/nategeier' target='_blank'>@Nate</a> and <a href='https://twitter.com/CarolinWend' target='_blank'>@Carolin</a>, have an amazing vision, amazing team, and we are impressed by the way they’ve build Mintbase.io on a bootstrapped budget. It is their view that NFTs function like APIs as they magnify innovation and fundamentally transforms economies. As the space matures, NFTs will play a key role in how we interact with each other online and in virtual worlds and environments. Understanding their vision, we have decided to invest to support their vision and also hope to support them with our China-centric network.


To illustrate some key highlights of Mintbase that demonstrate their results so far:

- ~850 Created Stores
- ~43K Total Minted tokens
- ~2,300 NFTs sold

Their strategic positioning as the Wix/Taobao of NFTs positions them in the center of a growing ecosystem — they maintain a valuable two-sided marketplace supporting content providers and buyers, all the while facilitating easier access for your average individual to the Web 3 revolution, something we are passionate about.


With regards to Mintbase’s coming integration with NEAR, we believe it shows prudent long-term planning. For some applications, Ethereum suffers high gas fees which would make it costly to deploy stores and mint NFTs, thus slowing growth. NEAR will provide significantly lower gas fees.



## Conclusion

In summary, the NFT industry has just begun, Mintbase will be at the forefront of this growing space. Game rewards, virtual real estate, collectibles and tickets are only the beginning. For future trends, NFTs will possibly expand to personal experiences and financial products such as derivatives and indexes. The possibilities with NFTs are endless. We look forward to seeing Mintbase continue on their exciting roadmap and are thrilled to be a contributor.
