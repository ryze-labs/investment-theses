# Why we invested in Mask Network

Not financial advice.



## Introduction

As early adopters and investors, we have been keeping a close eye on the development of the next age of the internet; Web 3.0. There are numerous definitions of Web 3.0, however, the tenets of privacy, personal control of information, decentralization, and highly contextual transactions remain consistent across most definitions.


Web 3.0 users do not need to rely on big tech companies or other third parties to provide these benefits or hold their data securely. They are built into the ecosystem itself. So, what is Web 3.0 and why is it important?


## What is Web 3.0?

One issue of the current web as we know it (Web 2.0) is that it lacks a shared “state” (recorded data layer) tied to user identity. This leads to the centralization of data, usually by “BigTech” firms, e.g. FAANG.


A key pillar of Web 3.0 is that users can regain control of their data, all in a censor-proof network. Blockchains are essentially a database, encrypted and shared among peers rather than on a central third-party server.

In essence, blockchain will be a new layer on the next web; the recorded data layer. Services need not necessarily change at all, merely the ownership of user data. Users can issue a self-sovereign identity without requiring a government or corporation for verification. Zero-knowledge proofs could be employed to authorize a user without any personal information being shared. However, Web 3.0 doesn’t stop with giving ownership back to the user.


Since the creation of the EVM (the first decentralized Turing-complete computer system) and the explosion of DApps, new applications on the web will not just allow the secure transfer of information, but natively allow the secure transfer of value.

To understand the developments and trends of decentralization, as well as amplify the underlying motivation, we have leveraged a research deck from Delphi Digital.

An obvious and likely early use case of the next generation web will be in social media, given its already pervasive presence throughout our lives. Decentralized social media platforms will allow users to fully own and monetize their internet lives and data. A recent debate has arisen on censorship in social media. At the moment, most platforms allow anyone to post, but only allow a few to censor. Web 3.0 can democratize control; everyone can have an equal say in the rules and how they would like the platform to function.


In essence, Web 3.0 allows for community governance, where power rests with users, not in the hands of a few owners or moderators. So, where do we start to make the gradual transition to Web 3.0? Enter Mask Network.



## Mask Network

<a href='https://mask.io/' target='_blank'>Mask Network</a> is building technology that supports the transition from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0 while supporting some of the important tenets we noted above.

It allows users to seamlessly send encrypted messages, cryptocurrencies, and even Dapps (Defi, NFTs) via social networks like Twitter and Facebook. Mask has an interesting strategy for initial user onboarding and the long-term transition to Web 3.0. We believe they share the same growth strategy as Metamask; leveraging Web 2.0 user habits and network size to grow their own user base.


However, Mask have integrated more directly into current Web 2.0 user experiences by adding a direct layer over social media. We’ll explain a few key use cases and then illustrate why we find the strategy and tech to be visionary.

1.  **Privacy and user control**: Sending encrypted posts to friends on Twitter/FB. As our good friend [@balajis](https://twitter.com/balajis) noted: “\[Mask\] Basically turns any platform into an E2E messaging app.” We’re excited at the prospect of building on top of platforms with such promising network effects.
2.  **Contextual Transactions**: While using Twitter, you can hover over a “$+ticker”, e.g. “$ETH”, to view token prices and trade on Uniswap without leaving Twitter. This creates a better user experience. Furthermore, payments / donations can be sent in Gitcoin on top of social media.
3.  **Decentralization/DeFi**: “Red packets” with crypto rewards can be easily shared on top of social media, giving KOLs a way to reward followers, among other uses. This could be expanded to limited edition NFT figures as part of marketing campaigns.

For reference, “red packets” or “hongbao (红包)” were popularized on Tencent’s WeChat platform. In 2019 <a href='https://www.zdnet.com/article/over-800-million-wechat-users-sent-digital-monetary-gifts-during-lunar-new-year/' target='_blank'>over 800M red packets</a> were given in a period during the Lunar New Year.


These are just a few initial use cases. Other uses will span gaming (think cryptokitties distributed over social media), e-commerce, regulatory arbitrage, content creation and usage as well as defi/dapplet ecosystems to name a few. These illustrate the genius of Mask and the great team led by <a href='https://twitter.com/sujiyan' target='_blank'>@sujiyan</a>. Mask is a bridge from Web 2.0 to Web 3.0, combining the best of both worlds.


Mask benefits from the strong distribution, reach, and network effects of Web 2.0 (Facebook alone has 2.6B users) combined with the privacy, decentralization, and context of Web 3.0.

## Potential Challenges

There are, however, also potential challenges or threats that could exist. Bridging Web 2.0 with Web 3.0 is not an easy task to do. This means that more sophisticated and unknown cyber threats could emerge. As Web 3.0 solutions become more dominant and Mask Network becomes a more prominent player in the industry, “BigTechs” like Facebook and Twitter could increase pressure on solutions like Mask.



## Conclusion

This is an ever developing industry, moving at an unprecedented speed. Therefore, both opportunities and threats could emerge alongside innovation. One thing seems to be certain with this technology trend: Web 3.0 solutions are going to play an increasing role in society.


We look forward to supporting Mask and team with our expertise and China-centric network. Don’t forget to give <a href='https://twitter.com/realmaskbook' target='_blank'>@realmaskbook</a> a follow to show your support and follow their developments.


Also, don’t forget to install the browser extension to be able to decrypt posts, receive red packets, and trade crypto, all while never leaving social media.
