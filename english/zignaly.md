## Zignaly’s solution

There are some market inefficiencies which make platforms like Zignaly attractive to novice investors:

- Exchanges. Leading cryptocurrency exchanges compete in a red ocean environment, focusing on providing sophisticated services which can be daunting for first-time investors and traders. Zignaly integrates with leading exchanges in a plug-and-play manner, offering the liquidity of exchanges to a blue ocean of new investors that are willing to put their capital to work in a more effective and efficient way.

Zignaly has created an ecosystem that connects investors and traders of all levels where traders can monetize their skills and establish a trustworthy reputation based on their engagement and performance.

## Profit Sharing & Copy Trading

What makes profit sharing unique and more beneficial than regular copy trading is that users are only required to pay a success fee when the positions reach a new high. In this way, both the investor and the trader have an aligned incentive, resulting in optimal execution of the trading strategy from beginning to end.


We illustrate the differences in a table below:

## Zignaly’s Security Focus

Safety and security are a priority for Zignaly. To provide a reliable and robust social trading ecosystem, Zignaly has the following safety measures:

- Non-custodial. Zignaly does not hold the funds of their users. They are protected on the exchange side.
- Advanced encryption and secure storage. API keys are RSA-encrypted and stored in a database which is an isolated DMZ with no public access. Zignaly uses a certificate for encrypting and decrypting their API-keys which is separated and kept secure outside their servers.
- 2FA. Zignaly offers 2FA authentication which is required for getting access to a user’s account.

## Insurance Protocol

Many newcomers to investing are not fully aware of the associated risks and repercussions of investing. To mitigate common risks, while also protecting new users, Zignaly has constructed an innovative insurance protocol. The investor selects a pro trader and invests the intended capital. In a situation where the trader generates less return than the arranged percentage, the insurance protocol will automatically reimburse the difference, leveraging ZIG coin to provide the underlying protection against losses using NFT based insurance.


Now let’s have a deep dive into the insurance mechanics, consisting of four key elements:

- ZIG Coin. ZIG forms an indispensable component of Zignaly’s insurance protocol, providing users the ability to hedge against volatility and safeguard 10%-100% of their investment.
- NFTs. The in-house Zignaly NFTs system creates a comprehensive tracking system that simplifies the monitoring of inflows and outflows on the platform.
- Fund Value Formula. In order to mitigate significant losses for users, and to provide stable insurance pool liquidity, the Zignaly NFT is presented in conjunction with the fund formula.
- Drawback Percentage. Zignaly’s flexible and dynamic insurance model assesses the risk level of traders in real time. This is based on their historic trading performance as well as market intelligence. The risk is determined by a constantly adjusting formula known as the drawback percentage rate. This aims to gauge risk within the protocol.

## ZIG token

Use cases:

- Transfer of Value. ZIG is key for the Zignaly insurance NFTs. Futhermore, users of the Zignaly platform can opt to get paid in ZIG upon completion of insurance. The premiums within the insurance pool are also paid in ZIG, which can be easily converted to stablecoins.
- Governance. ZIG holders will possess voting rights on platform updates and innovative features. Additionally, ZIG will grant early access to novel social trading features on the Zignaly platform.
- Discounted Platform-Wide Fees. Insurance fees, profit sharing services, trade commission rebates are all paid in ZIG.
- Loyalty and Rewards. The implementation of NFTs within the Zignaly ecosystem permits the creation of loyalty and reward focused NFTs which will be available for ZIG liquidity providers, borrowers or lenders.

## Risks and Threats
- Regulations & Licensing: Potentially the largest potential hurdle in this space for all participants. Zignaly has already onboarded experienced consultants who are advising on licensing and jurisdictional decisions. To research and mitigate any future regulatory uncertainties, Zignaly is allocating 20% of raised funds to tackle this problem.
- Expert Trader Retention: Another common problem among social trading platforms is trader retention. Acquiring new customers is important, but if the right incentives aren’t in place to maintain investors and traders, users may move to their competitors. To mitigate this risk, Zignaly is working on some innovative initiatives and incentive programs to acquire and retain skilled traders in the industry.
- Competition: As mentioned above, social trading is an up-and-coming but extremely competitive market with many similar service providers. We believe Zignaly stands out from the crowd with an extremely dedicated and receptive team who truly cares about their users. By emphasizing on profit sharing and active engagement with their investors and traders, Zignaly could be the go-to platform in the space.

## Future Opportunities & Trends
- Social Explosion: The world has truly gone social. In today’s world, narrative is controlled and driven by social media. Traders and investors want to show off their trading prowess and profits, which is a huge opportunity for Zignaly.
- Crypto Adoption: The 2020 and 2021 crypto bull run has everyone talking about the crypto market with millions of people are entering the industry for the first time. This is where the opportunity lies; providing a hassle free, simple UI/UX platform to these enthusiastic newcomers. As exchanges are seeing more trading volume, the demand for supporting services such as social trading are expected to grow further.

## Conclusion

As blockchain and cryptocurrencies evolve and continue their rapid maturity, the need for simple and accessible investment platforms will grow. We expect social trading to become a more prominent industry in the space as more newcomers and passive investors entering the ecosystem. Zignaly will be the first port of call for many investors beginning their crypto journey, as a bridge for investors and traders - providing a social platform for them to communicate, share ideas and execute trades in a trustable, secure and equitable manner.
