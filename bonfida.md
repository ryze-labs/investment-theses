# Why we invested in Bonfida

Not financial advice

## Introduction

Bonfida DEX offers a seamless Graphical User Interface to trade on Serum. Why does this matter?


In 2018, the blockchain ecosystem learned an important lesson; Decentralized Applications (DApps) that did not have a better UX than their centralized peers, would not be adopted. Simply put: to drive adoption, decentralized solutions need to be paired with great UI and UX.

<br>

## DEXes and Serum

Over the past year, we’ve seen a massive growth of interest and usage in the DeFi space. Much of this has been concentrated on Decentralized Exchanges (DEXes) such as Uniswap. Serum (<a href='https://projectserum.com/' target='_blank'>https://projectserum.com/</a>), a next generation DEX, is the world’s first completely decentralized derivatives exchange with trustless cross-chain trading. Serum has the advantage of being a DEX with an orderbook allowing essential trading features to be built (more on this later). For Serum to reach its full potential, it needs a UI/UX experience comparable to the best CEXs in the ecosystem.

## Why Bonfida?

It is this need for an intuitive, seamless and visually appealing UI/UX that makes Bonfida DEX vital for the sustained health and growth of the Serum DEX. Bonfida offers a seamless GUI to trade on Serum.


Bonfida has over a very short period become the primary GUI for users to interact with Serum. The Bonfida API is used by some of the largest market makers in the space and has seen a growth in requests of 25% week over week. The Bonfida REST API serves data directly from the Serum DEX. According to the latest available stats at time of writing, Bonfida’s serum API has reached 8.7 mil requests:

Serum DEX has reached a daily volume of approximately US$2.22 million, with Bonfida currently handling ~50%. Bonfida has already become the leading gateway to Serum.


We believe that DEXs are an inevitable and powerful alternative to centralized exchanges. Serum has the potential to dominate this field and eventually become the market leader while Bonfida will contribute and accelerate this growth while providing differentiation from competitors.

## On Serum

To understand why we invested in Bonfida, it’s important to understand the advantages of Serum. Serum provides features that are unique to DEXs, including:

- Completely peer to peer with no centralized exchange intermediary.
- Fees usually lower given peer-to-peer structure.
- DEXs are non-custodial, meaning you can trade your crypto assets without entrusting them to a third party and even use a hardware wallet to securely use the platform.
- Completely decentralized and transparent orderbook.


We believe these features will be very attractive to certain users. However, for DEXs like Serum to reach their full potential, they will need a seamless and simple user interface. Enter Bonfida.

## Features

Bonfida aims to bring the full features of a centralized exchange to the Serum DEX. It provides features such as trading bots, NFT exchange, a slick GUI, wallet etc.

## FIDA Token

Bonfida has a native token, FIDA, that will be fully integrated into the platform and has governance control over all fees earned on Bonfida. FIDA accrues all of its value through the following products and services:

- Bonfida Serum GUI: Bonfida DEX will provide traders the most optimal functionality and experience given its purpose to amplify the usage of the Serum DEX, e.g. via charts, wallets etc.
- Bonfida Serum API: current users of the API include Coingecko, Coinmarketcap and few large market makers in the industry. The intention here is to scale and to provide users a CEX like experience, while having the characteristics and features of a DEX.
- Serum Dashboard: aggregating all elements of Serum such as the Serum GUI, swap, borrow/lending, staking in one place through their dashboard.
- Bonfida trading bots: on-chain trading bots for Serum. In furthering their goal to bring a fully featured experience to Serum, the team has also created “Bonfida Bots”. Users can now create on-chain trading bots leveraging technical indicators for a completely automated trading experience. Furthermore, in adding more utility to the native token, users can earn FIDA by selling subscriptions to their strategies.
- Solible: NFT exchange built on top of Serum and Solana. The Bonfida team have innovated and adopted NFTs with the creation of Solible (https://solible.com), allowing for the decentralized trading of NFTs.

## Conclusion

The FIDA IEO will take place on FTX and Bitmax. In addition, Bonfida will be the first project to conduct an ISO on Serum. These features are just the beginning, however. The team at Bonfida led by David Ratiney have big plans for the future. We have full confidence in the team’s ability to continue to add innovative features to the platform, bringing the full featured CEX experience to DEX and become the primary interface for Serum.
